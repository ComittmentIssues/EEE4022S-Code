# EEE4022S-Code

This is the program created to test the implementation of the RRT algorythm.

# File Layout

The folder consists of a Visual studio .sln file and root folder "opencvtry2" with the code. Images are included for testing. The program
utilizes openCV and contains 2 .lib files

# How to use the program

Change the filename on the first line of the main function to select a picture. If using a satelite image, uncomment the "satelitetoCspace" function and comment out the img.clone()
For regular images, do the opposite

additional functions are already in the code structure and can be commented/uncommented to view the effects

Use the mouse to select  a start and end point on the picture and enter a branch length on the console window. 

Enjoy!
